/**
 * @file IntPrinter.hpp IntPrinter Class Interface
 *
 * IntPrinter is a class which prints an integer represented by a
 * ValueWrapper class instance on demand
 *
 * The IntPrinter interface is available to developers who link
 * toylibrary into their applications and libraries. It's not an
 * intrinsically useful class, but that's not the point: this is just
 * to show how developers can incorporate a class into a library for
 * others to use in the DUNE DAQ framework.
 *
 * This is part of the DUNE DAQ Application Framework, copyright 2020.
 * Licensing/copyright details are in the COPYING file that you should have
 * received with this code.
