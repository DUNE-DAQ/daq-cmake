  // TO package DEVELOPERS: PLEASE DELETE THIS FOLLOWING COMMENT AFTER READING IT
  // For any run control command it is possible for a DAQModule to
  // register an action that will be executed upon reception of the
  // command. do_conf is a very common example of this; in
  // RenameMe.cpp you would implement do_conf so that members of
  // RenameMe get assigned values from a configuration passed as 
  // an argument and originating from the CCM system.

  void do_conf(const data_t&);

  // TO package DEVELOPERS: PLEASE DELETE THIS FOLLOWING COMMENT AFTER READING IT 
  // m_total_amount and m_amount_since_last_get_info_call are examples
  // of variables whose values get reported to OpMon
  // (https://github.com/mozilla/opmon) each time get_info() is
  // called. "amount" represents a (discrete) value which changes as RenameMe
  // runs and whose value we'd like to keep track of during running;
  // obviously you'd want to replace this "in real life"
